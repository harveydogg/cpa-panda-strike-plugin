# In order of importance
## Change member expiration dates
- updated the expiration date on all monthly woo memberships which were active and set to expire before 2018-01-31, 1286 affected. you mentioned 4k users, wondering if i'm making an incorrect assumption somewhere.

## Site search and forum search
- I've added the forum search widget to the sidebar, may need css tweaking? appears to be functional though

## Forum layout
- I've added a direct link to the navigation to /forums/forum/cpa-forums/, can be edited in the wp-admin > appearence > menus. this should drop the user into the list with all the forums. i tried making the url friendlier but wordpress/bbpress wasn't having any of it

## General overview of the site.
- I think considering the confines of wordpress and all the plugins and whatnot that it looks pretty good!

# Not critical
## Add temporary forum ban feature
- I didn't find a plugin for this nor a way for moderators to set a temporary ban. Easiest is probably a new user role which the admin can associate with a user, problem is that requires an admin

## Full name
- I think it's already doing this?

## Layout
- I think the layout is functional and it looks clean enough that most of these old pilots should be able to figure it out, i mean they can fly planes right.
- The major item that stands out to me on the mobile nav is the fixed menu at the bottom of the viewport with the 3 buttons. It might be a good idea to display:none this as long as it doesn't hork the checkout flow too much when someone is buying something.
- Did the copyright text used to live in the footer? I think the locations of widgets may have reset when I disabled/activated the theme.

Tasks / TODO:
1) https://cessnapilotsassociation.com/my-account/, click on memberships. That page is just supposed to show what memberships you have. For some weird reason at some point, not sure when, it was only noticed within the past week, for some reason it now shows forum posts which it wasn’t doing before. I’m pretty sure it’s only supposed to show the Wooo memberships you’re part of
	should link to https://cessnapilotsassociation.com/my-account/members-area/7289/my-membership-details/
2) "The other item I’d like to work on, doesn’t have to be now or today, for context, is I’d like to change the membership expiration dates for about half the users. The way I thought I could do this didn’t work."
